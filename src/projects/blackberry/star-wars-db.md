Most Application will require to access and manipulate data in some way through
an API.

I discovered the [SWAPI API](http://swapi.co "SWAPI") and started playing around with it to create a Database of Star Wars stuff.

The idea was very simple, just access and interconnect all data from the API to create a web of Star Wars Information including Films, Characters and Starships.

I created a Web Application first using Angular JS and then transferred the code to a BlackBerry WebWorks Application using the BBUI.js framework for a native BlackBerry 10 look & feel.

All routes are dynamically generated by the application based upon the API Data.

An option to download all the API data and store locally means that the application runs more quickly and is available off-line.

I also produced an Angular web application of the Star Wars Database which you can view [here](https://forbesg.github.io/star-wars-db/ "Star Wars DB")
