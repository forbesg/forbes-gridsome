The Beauty Edinburgh Website is a something that has evolved over time.

In its infancy, the site was created using the very limited Google Sites platform.
This of course is a product which has its uses however building a modern customer
facing image is not one.

After the frustrations of trying to 'personalise' the Google Site, the project
started from scratch as a simple static html site. As I progressed with the rebuild
I was learning _html_ and _css_ as I went along, but after little time the website
was looking much more like a business website should.

At the same time, mobile devices were really becoming more of a consideration,
and I spent more of my time getting to grips with _media queries_. Although the
third generation mobile friendly version of the site was working well, I was very
aware that older browsers and some of the mobile browsers were not supporting many
of the _CSS3_ features that I was implementing.

In addition to this I had starting picking up some _PHP_ and was discovering the
lack of _DRY_ in my workflow. The site was loosely transferred to _PHP_ and I was
able include common parts of the site (head, header &amp; footer) to simplify
the process of making any further changes.

The fourth, and current, version of the site introduced _Bootstrap_ and immediately
I found a lot of my headaches went away. The ability to work responsively out of
the box was a big plus and although there was a fair bit of work 'tweaking' it,
the end result was much more resilient.
