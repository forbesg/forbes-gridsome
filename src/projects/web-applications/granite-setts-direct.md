#### Server-side Rendered Headless E-Commerce Application

I was approached by Granite Setts Direct Ltd to develop an e-commerce website to
sell [granite setts in the UK](https://www.granitesettsdirect.co.uk).

On review of their competitors websites, we felt that there was a real opportunity
to make the online buying process faster and more enjoyable for the customer. Traditional
e-commerce platforms felt slow and cumbersome to navigate so the aim was to create a
fast and straight forward and uncluttered user experience.

After our initial discussions with the client we agreed that we would use Vue to create
the UI and the [Nuxt JS](https://nuxtjs.org/) framework to take advantage of server-side rendering. In order to
integrate the e-commerce functionality without the weight of a full blown E-Commerce
framework, we integrated the [Moltin](https://moltin.com/) headless E-Commerce API which made the overall site very
light-weight, fast and responsive. This also allowed us to take full control of the
flow of the buying process.

To design the site I worked closely with the client to create a clean, uncomplicated
visual experience to allow to customer to focus on the product itself.
