## What is a Brochure Website? {class="highlight-overline"}

### A cost effective way to introduce your business

A brochure website is the face of your business' brand, and is a fantastic way to showcase your business and its services to the world. A brochure site can be a great cost effective way to find new customers or gain business leads and contacts.

Unlike an [e-commerce website](/services/ecommerce-website-design/), a brochure site does not directly sell products to the customer, but introduces your products or services, and draws contact and engagment from the customer.

Although I am an Edinburgh based Website Developer, I am happy to work remotely with customers further afield.
