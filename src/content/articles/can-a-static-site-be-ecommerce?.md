## Ecommerce Options Available

Traditionally e-commerce websites have been created using well-established frameworks
like Shopify, Magento & WooCommerce. More recently these have been joined by the likes of
BigCommerce, Squarespace & Wix, all of which provide a quick and easy way of starting
to sell online.

What all of the aforementioned e-commerce platforms have in common is that they are
tightly coupled with the storefront that the customer sees. Both website and admin
backend are running together on the same server and it is that server which creates
the e-commerce website. In addition to this, there are limitations in terms of
developing the site exactly as you want it. The design of the site is constrained
by the platform itself, and the more flexible a platform is in the design options,
the more expensive it becomes to develop.

## Headless Ecommerce

A more recent addition to the e-commerce space has been the headless e-commerce
framework. Headless simply refers to the fact that the framework itself doesn't
have a storefront, it simply implements the e-commerce backend functionality whilst
leaving you free to create, design and customise your online shop using any
technology you like. The website (or App...or both) then makes API calls to the e-commerce backend
to display to the user and facilitate the sales.

The headless e-commerce space has become very busy very quickly with frameworks
like Elasticpath, Vendure and Open Source Sylius whilst the likes of Magento, BigCommerce
and Shopify have created Headless versions of their frameworks.

### Omnichannel Sales

Using a headless e-commerce architecture opens up a wide variety of additional
sales channels and routes to market. A headless e-commerce solution can not only
allow sales through a website but also provides e-commerce functionality to
Mobile Apps, IoT devices and in-person Point of Sale devices.

### Design Flexibility

With this level of decoupling of the front and backend of an e-commerce framework,
you achieve total freedom to create a unique and fast shopping experience for the user and
a faster time to market. It also allows you to easily change your storefront website
in the future, whether that be design or underlying technology, without touching
any of the e-commerce backend code.

Many large multi-national businesses' have embraced this new architecture
to improve their customer's shopping experience, including Nike, Under Armour,
Target & Debenhams.

## Taking Headless Ecommerce Static

Due to the nature of modern static site generators and website build tools,
headless e-commerce can fit perfectly into this architecture. Communication is
made to the headless API during the build process and creates a static website
that can be hosted on any server at a minimal cost.

Realtime interactions with the backend, such as authentication, inventory
queries and sales, can be handled using API requests whilst the user interacts
with the site.

For those on an ultra-low budget, products like Snipcart enable e-commerce functionality
to be added to any static website with little more than adding a snippet of code to
the site.

### Conclusion

There are many e-commerce solutions available and the ideal solution will depend on a business' requirements
and budget.

We continue to promote a headless approach to developing e-commerce websites and
